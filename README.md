# Quickstart with Nitrous.io
Nitrous.io is a great remote workstation that I tend to use when I need to make changes to code like this on the fly.

Start up a workstation with the node.js configuration. Run the following commands to checkout the repository and run the nitrous initialization script. When it's done you will have the dashboard running on port 4000 and the website running on 8080. The default dashboard username and password is tmp. You can use the preview buttons to get at them.

    git clone https://github.com/gnu-lorien/yorick.git ~/code/yorick
    bash ~/code/yorick/dotfiles/initialize_nitrous.bash
